# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

- Check-in and check-out time support across admin and frontend booking flows.
- Timeline-specific assets (CSS/JS) with localization and translation updates.

### Changed
- Booking validation to enforce 1â€“6 hour durations and prevent overlapping reservations with cleanup buffers.
